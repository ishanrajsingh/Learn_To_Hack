COMMAND NAME: watch

WHAT IT IS:
The watch command is the command that you apply when you need to be able to observe something in real time- when you are awaiting that lab result or just want to know how a process is acting. It only repeats and repeats that one command after every few seconds and throws the out the results immediately into your terminal.

SYNTAX:
watch [options] command

BASIC EXAMPLES:
watch ls
Scans the files every couple of seconds to present the updated file list to you, which means that you can always see the list of newly uploaded files.

watch -n 1 date
Tells your current date and time by the second- it comes in handy when you are rushing on a deadline.

COMMON OPTIONS:
-n seconds
-n seconds Select the frequency of refreshing.  
-d            : Bell-ringing type diffing-bluks indicate the changes to the diffing which occurred between the previous run and this one.  
-t            Turn of the header line and clutter it up.

EXAMPLE WITH OPTIONS:
watch -d -n 2 df -h
